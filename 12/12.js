//Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each person’s name,
// print a message to them. The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their name.
//Explain & TIP: This builds on the previous exercise. Now, you’re not just listing names, you’re using them in a sentence to make a personalized message for each friend.
